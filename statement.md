# Project Statement: Vityarthi Library Management System

## Problem Statement
Traditional library management often relies on manual record-keeping, leading to errors in tracking book inventory and member borrowing history. This project aims to digitize these records to ensure data accuracy and efficiency.

## Scope of the Project
This project creates a console-based application to manage:
- Book Inventory (Add, Update, Search)
- Member Records (Registration, Borrowing history)
- Transaction Management (Issue and Return books)
- Data Persistence (Saving data to files automatically)

## Target Users
- Library Administrators
- Student Librarians
- Educational Institute Staff

## High-Level Features
1. **Book Management:** Add new books and search by title/author.
2. **Member Management:** Register members and track their borrow counts.
3. **Borrowing System:** Validates limits (max 5 books) and stock availability.
4. **Persistence:** Automatically saves and loads data using Java Serialization.
